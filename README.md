# Analysis of Energy Consumption in India

## Description

This project aims to analyse the trends in energy consumption in India from 1970 to 2012.

The dataset used is World Development Indicators collected from the World Bank: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaggle/world-development-indicators. In this analysis, we aim to visualize how energy availability for rural, urban and the total population of India has changed in the last two decades. We also analyse how India's energy availability compares to other South Asian countries as defined by the World Bank (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka). We also aim to understand how the use of different sources of energy have changed over time.
